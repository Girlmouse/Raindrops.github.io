🌧 Raindrops

A moment in time.

Raindrops is a minimalist atmospheric tapping experience built for the browser.

Instead of traditional levels, the player chooses a scene and simply exists within it — listening to rain, tapping falling drops, and watching subtle environmental details unfold.

Each session is short, calm, and intentional.

🌌 Scenes

Raindrops currently includes seven distinct environments, each with its own tone and visual identity:

🌆 City – A quiet skyline under rain, windows glowing in the distance.

🌊 Ocean – Soft waves meeting rainfall at the horizon.

🏔 Mountain – A moonlit lake beneath distant peaks.

🌲 Forest – A layered woodland scene with subtle movement.

🐸 Swamp – Heavy air, still water, and slow drifting atmosphere.

🖤 Noir – High-contrast monochrome rain inspired by cinematic minimalism.

🚀 Space – Rain falling in impossible silence across the cosmos.

Each environment is designed using a limited color palette to maintain a cohesive, moody aesthetic.

🎮 Gameplay

Tap falling raindrops to collect them.

Sessions last a short, intentional duration.

A quote appears at the end of each session.

The experience is calm and non-linear — no pressure, no enemies, no failure.

Raindrops is about atmosphere, not competition.

🎨 Design Philosophy

Raindrops uses:

Minimal UI

Limited color palettes

Layered depth

Subtle animation

Soft audio feedback

The goal is to create a quiet, immersive moment rather than a traditional game loop.
